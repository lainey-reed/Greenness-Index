Code modelling2.R is the most recent file I have been working on, with my most recent work further down in the script. I have been trying to use the nls.multstart package to fit a model to the data, organized by the dominant plant groups in the photo. The picture nls_multstart_green_est.png is an image with the model I produced using this method.
